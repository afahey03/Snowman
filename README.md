# Snowman

## Intro
A project made as an introduction to Swift, built by Aidan Fahey and Connor Dailey (College of the Holy Cross 2025)

## The Program
- Snowman is a simple hangman clone in which the user has to guess the letters of a word.
- When the user guesses an incorrect letter, part of the snowman is built and shows up on the screen.
- Picks a word at random using a dictionary of about 47,000 words, including apostrophes.
- The game ends when the snowman is fully built.
